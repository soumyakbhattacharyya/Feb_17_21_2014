Create a page called Day09Lab.html
Create an array of countries with their capital as given below;

arr[“India”] = “Chennai”;
arr[“UK”] = “London”;
arr[“Spain”] = “Madrid”;
arr[“France”] = “Paris”;
arr[“Japan”] = “Tokyo”;

Here’re the tasks to be done;

1) When the page loads construct a table with the following columns.

Temperatures

Country 		City 	  Min 	Max  Time

India   		Chennai    21	32	  27/02/14, 2:00 PM
Spain   		Madrid     1 	12	  27/02/14, 2:00 PM

…


2) You will get the temperature of each city by sending an AJAX request to the following URL.
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=CITY,COUNTRY&units=metric&callback=test

Study the output this URL to begin with.
Replace the CITY and COUNTRY with appropriate values from the array

3) Every 10 seconds you will send a request to this site passing the city values and getting the response and displaying it.
That means, even if the temperature doesn’t really change in 10 seconds the Time column will keep changing.
When a particular city’s temperature is being requested that row in the table should become red in color indicating that new temperature is being computed.

4) If you move to a different tab in the browser, the AJAX calls need to be suspended and should be resumed once the user activates the tab.

5) When you close and open the browser page the table should contain the previously computed temperatures.

REMEMBER THE BASICS

Do not write CSS/JS code in HTML file
Try to write modularize JavaScript like Acct.ajax() or TextBox class.
Use SASS if you can

Do not give up;
