AJAX code is getting messier and clumsy. Let's modularize it.
-->Create a file called Ajax.js. Define your AJAX code in it in such a way that, from now if you want to send AJAX requests you will just write the following.

Acct.ajax({
	url : "the url goes here",
	success : function(response){
		//response will be the actual response from the server
	}
});

So, you don't have to worry about writing XMLHttpRequest related code all the time.
